## Getting Started

This is my Rock Paper Scissors project using Java

Objectives:

To create a Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer.

1) Focus on the 'computer' to print out Rock, Paper Scissors randomly:
 - Use If statement to print out one of the options randomly.

 2) User input - Have a user input number 1-3, 1 representing Scissors, 2 is for Paper, 3 is for Rock.

 3) Use If statement to print out the output depending on the user input for either Rock,Paper,Scissors.

 4) Determine who is the winner, Rock beats paper but loses to paper. Paper beats Rock but loses to Scissors. Scissors beats paper but loses to Rock. - May need to add an If statement to determine the winner.

 5) Prints out the winner.

 BONUS:

 - Input images to match the output. 
 - Add others into the mix. 
 - Develop into an actual web application that can be played online.
